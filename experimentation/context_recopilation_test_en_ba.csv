In 1742, Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, proposed the ""centigrade"" **temperature** scale, the predecessor of the current Celsius scale. In 1783, the first hair hygrometer was demonstrated by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure. In 1802–1803, Luke Howard wrote ""On the Modification of Clouds...","...ed cubic structure taking place at about 863 °C. Neodymium, like most of the lanthanides, is paramagnetic at room temperature. It becomes an antiferromagnet upon cooling below . Below this transition **temperature** it exhibits a set of complex magnetic phases that have long spin relaxation times and spin glass behavior. Neodymium is a rare-earth metal that was present in the classical mischmetal at a concentrat..."
