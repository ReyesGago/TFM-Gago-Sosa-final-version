1. ...al justification for Heaviside's operator method using contour integration. Heaviside was familiar with the Laplace transform method but considered his own method more direct. Heaviside developed the **transmission line** theory (also known as the "telegrapher's equations"), which had the effect of increasing the transmission rate over transatlantic cables by a factor of ten. It originally took ten minutes to transmit...
2. ...hronous grids. When electrical energy is transmitted over very long distances, the power lost in AC transmission becomes appreciable and it is less expensive to use direct current instead. For a long **transmission line**, these lower losses (and reduced construction cost of a DC line) can offset the cost of the required converter stations at each end. HVDC is used for long submarine cables where AC cannot be used bec...

...amplifier's output capacitively couples to its input it may become an electronic oscillator. Characteristic impedance The characteristic impedance or surge impedance (usually written Z) of a uniform **transmission line** is the ratio of the amplitudes of voltage and current of a wave travelling in one direction along the line in the absence of reflections in the other direction. Equivalently, it can be defined as the...

...failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down. One example of a long DC transmission line is the Pacific DC Intertie located in the Western United States. The amount of power that can be sent over a **transmission line** varies with the length of the line. The heating of short line conductors due to line losses sets a thermal limit. If too much current is drawn, conductors may sag too close to the ground, or conducto...

1. ...). Recent reviews and reference work on the subject include, Topp and Reynolds (1998), Noborio (2001), Pettinellia et al. (2002), Topp and Ferre (2002) and Robinson et al. (2003). The TDR method is a **transmission line** technique, and determines apparent permittivity (Ka) from the travel time of an electromagnetic wave that propagates along a transmission line, usually two or more parallel metal rods embedded in soi...
2. ...fficient and transmission constant. If the plural is used, it suggests that "α" and "β" are being referenced separately but collectively as in transmission parameters, propagation parameters, etc. In **transmission line** theory, "α" and "β" are counted among the "secondary coefficients", the term "secondary" being used to contrast to the "primary line coefficients". The primary coefficients are the physical propertie...
3. ...ere along the transmission line. Their magnitudes remain constant along the length of the line and are only rotated by a phase angle. In electric power transmission, the characteristic impedance of a **transmission line** is expressed in terms of the surge impedance loading (SIL), or natural loading, being the power loading at which reactive power is neither produced nor absorbed: formula_106 in which formula_107 is t...

Merchant transmission projects in the United States include the Cross Sound Cable from Shoreham, New York to New Haven, Connecticut, Neptune RTS **Transmission Line** from Sayreville, New Jersey, to New Bridge, New York, and Path 15 in California. Additional projects are in development or have been proposed throughout the United States, including the Lake Erie Con...
2. ...is called power-line carrier, or power-line communication (PLC). PLC signals can be easily received with a radio in the long wave range. Optical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a **transmission line**, in the overhead shield wires. These cables are known as optical ground wire ("OPGW"). Sometimes a standalone cable is used, all-dielectric self-supporting ("ADSS") cable, attached to the transmissio...
3. ...ays at each end of the line must communicate to monitor the flow of power so that faulted conductors or equipment can be quickly de-energized and the balance of the system restored. Protection of the **transmission line** from short circuits and other faults is usually so critical that common carrier telecommunications are insufficiently reliable, while in some remote areas no common carrier is available. Communicatio...
