Translate these contexts into Spanish:
1. ...amplifier's output capacitively couples to its input it may become an electronic oscillator. Characteristic impedance The characteristic impedance or surge impedance (usually written Z) of a uniform **transmission line** is the ratio of the amplitudes of voltage and current of a wave travelling in one direction along the line in the absence of reflections in the other direction. Equivalently, it can be defined as the...
2. ...failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down. One example of a long DC transmission line is the Pacific DC Intertie located in the Western United States. The amount of power that can be sent over a **transmission line** varies with the length of the line. The heating of short line conductors due to line losses sets a thermal limit. If too much current is drawn, conductors may sag too close to the ground, or conducto...

...e had encountered Maxwell's newly published, and later famous, two-volume "Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism". In his old age Heaviside recalled: Undertaking research from home, he helped develop **transmission line** theory (also known as the ""telegrapher's equations""). Heaviside showed mathematically that uniformly distributed inductance in a telegraph line would diminish both attenuation and distortion, and t...

A 15 kV **transmission line**, approximately 175 km long, connected Lauffen on the Neckar and Frankfurt. Transmission voltages increased throughout the 20th century. By 1914, fifty-five transmission systems operating at more than...

1. ...prism case, some light leaks out at the prism corners). An "acoustic waveguide" is a physical structure for guiding sound waves. Sound in an acoustic waveguide behaves like electromagnetic waves on a **transmission line**. Waves on a string, like the ones in a tin can telephone, are a simple example of an acoustic waveguide. Another example are pressure waves in the pipes of an organ. The term "acoustic waveguide" is...

3. ...fficient and transmission constant. If the plural is used, it suggests that "α" and "β" are being referenced separately but collectively as in transmission parameters, propagation parameters, etc. In **transmission line** theory, "α" and "β" are counted among the "secondary coefficients", the term "secondary" being used to contrast to the "primary line coefficients". The primary coefficients are the physical propertie...

3. ...is called power-line carrier, or power-line communication (PLC). PLC signals can be easily received with a radio in the long wave range. Optical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a **transmission line**, in the overhead shield wires. These cables are known as optical ground wire ("OPGW"). Sometimes a standalone cable is used, all-dielectric self-supporting ("ADSS") cable, attached to the transmissio...
