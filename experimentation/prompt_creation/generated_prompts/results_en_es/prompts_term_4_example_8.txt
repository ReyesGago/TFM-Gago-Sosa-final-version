1. ...nature of sources of plasma and momentum, the period of the object's spin, the nature of the axis about which the object spins, the axis of the magnetic dipole, and the magnitude and direction of the **flow** of solar wind. The planetary distance where the magnetosphere can withstand the solar wind pressure is called the Chapman–Ferraro distance. This is usefully modeled by the formula wherein formula_1 r...

...her kinds of image processing, video processing, audio processing, and speech processing. Instrumentation engineering deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure, **flow**, and temperature. The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, flight instruments measure variables such as w...

...he magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a voltage source connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents **flow** in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero. According to Faraday's law, since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ide...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where flow translates as caudal:
1. ...ula_22 is the speed of light and ∇· denotes the divergence of a tensor field. Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the energy flux (**flow** of "energy" per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism for more details. The density of powe...
2. ...n differential and integral form follows likewise. The line integrals and curls are analogous to quantities in classical fluid dynamics: the circulation of a fluid is the line integral of the fluid's **flow** velocity field around a closed loop, and the vorticity of the fluid is the curl of the velocity field. The invariance of charge can be derived as a corollary of Maxwell's equations. The left-hand sid...
3. ...ons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor. For a steady **flow** of charge through a surface, the current "I" (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation: formula_5 where "Q" is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time "t". If...

For large conductors (more than a few centimetres in diameter), much of the current **flow** is concentrated near the surface due to the skin effect. The center of the conductor carries little current but contributes weight and cost. Thus, multiple parallel cables (called bundle conductors)...
2. ...stant sources. Because of the economic benefits of load sharing, wide area transmission grids may span countries and even continents. Interconnections between producers and consumers enables power to **flow** even if some links are inoperative. The slowly varying portion of demand is known as the "base load" and is generally served by large facilities with constant operating costs, termed firm power. Such...
3. ...urrent may be specified for a given switch design. In electronics, switches are classified according to the arrangement of their contacts. A pair of contacts is said to be ""closed"" when current can **flow** from one to the other. When the contacts are separated by an insulating air gap, they are said to be ""open"", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages. The terms ""make"" for closure...
