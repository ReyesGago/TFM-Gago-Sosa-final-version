1. ...crystalline semiconductors, electrons can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of levels of energy). Energetically, these bands are located between the energy of the ground state, the **state** in which electrons are tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, the latter describing the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material...
2. ...computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage because secondary storage is less expensive. In modern computers, hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-**state** drives (SSDs) are usually used as secondary storage. The access time per byte for HDDs or SSDs is typically measured in milliseconds (thousandths of a second), while the access time per byte for prim...

...tum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting **state**. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of "perfect conductivity" in classical physics. In a semiconductor it is someti...

...media), formed once (write once media) or reversible (recordable or read/write media). The following forms are in common use : Magneto-optical disc storage is optical disc storage where the magnetic **state** on a ferromagnetic surface stores information. The information is read optically and written by combining magnetic and optical methods. Magneto-optical disc storage is "non-volatile", "sequential acc...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where state translates as estado:
1. ...m behaved as though it were negatively charged. In 1879, he proposed that these properties could be explained by regarding cathode rays as composed of negatively charged gaseous molecules in a fourth **state** of matter in which the mean free path of the particles is so long that collisions may be ignored. In 1883, not yet well-known German physicist Heinrich Hertz tried to prove that cathode rays are elec...
2. ...ve symmetric wave functions instead. In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or **state**. This is responsible for the Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For examp...
3. ...ble to give an approximation for the quantum-mechanical many-body state of the system of (attractively interacting) electrons inside the metal. This state is now known as the BCS state. In the normal **state** of a metal, electrons move independently, whereas in the BCS state, they are bound into Cooper pairs by the attractive interaction. The BCS formalism is based on the reduced potential for the electro...

1. ...nstantly changing clock causes many components to switch regardless of whether they are being used at that time. In general, a component that is switching uses more energy than an element in a static **state**. Therefore, as clock rate increases, so does energy consumption, causing the CPU to require more heat dissipation in the form of CPU cooling solutions. One method of dealing with the switching of unn...
2. ...al arguments, a local maximum, an unstable equilibrium point, must lie between the two minima. At rest, a particle will be in one of the minimum equilibrium positions, because that corresponds to the **state** of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualized as a barrier between them. A system can transition from one state of minimal energy to the other if it is given enough activation energy to penetrate t...
3. ...ith the control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired **state**, while minimizing any "delay", "overshoot", or "steady-state error" and ensuring a level of control stability; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality. To do this, a controller with the...
