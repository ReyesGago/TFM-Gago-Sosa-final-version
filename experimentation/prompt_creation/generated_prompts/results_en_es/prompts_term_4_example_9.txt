1. ...the lattice, given by "kT", where "k" is the Boltzmann constant and "T" is the temperature, the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The Cooper pair fluid is thus a superfluid, meaning it can **flow** without energy dissipation. In the class of superconductors known as type II superconductors, including all known high-temperature superconductors, an extremely low but non-zero resistivity appears a...
2. ...tor banks, reactors and other components (such as phase-shifters; static VAR compensators; and flexible AC transmission systems, FACTS) throughout the system help to compensate for the reactive power **flow**, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'. Current flowing through transmission lines induces a magnetic field...

Translate these contexts into Spanish taking into account that flow translates as caudal in Physics > Electro-magnetism, like the following example shows:
...ons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor. For a steady **flow** of charge through a surface, the current "I" (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation: formula_5 where "Q" is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time "t". If...

...urrent may be specified for a given switch design. In electronics, switches are classified according to the arrangement of their contacts. A pair of contacts is said to be ""closed"" when current can **flow** from one to the other. When the contacts are separated by an insulating air gap, they are said to be ""open"", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages. The terms ""make"" for closure...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where flow translates as caudal:
1. ...ula_22 is the speed of light and ∇· denotes the divergence of a tensor field. Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the energy flux (**flow** of "energy" per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism for more details. The density of powe...
2. ...om to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation: formula_11 where Typically, electric charges in solids **flow** slowly. For example, in a copper wire of cross-section 0.5 mm, carrying a current of 5 A, the drift velocity of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example,...
3. ...09. Producing hard, compact, insoluble, and infusible condensation products of phenols and formaldehyde marked the beginning of the modern plastics industry. Electric current An electric current is a **flow** of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. It is defined as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface. The moving particles are...

For large conductors (more than a few centimetres in diameter), much of the current **flow** is concentrated near the surface due to the skin effect. The center of the conductor carries little current but contributes weight and cost. Thus, multiple parallel cables (called bundle conductors)...
2. ...plica of this sound effect. The effects of contact bounce can be eliminated by: All of these methods are referred to as 'debouncing'. When the power being switched is sufficiently large, the electron **flow** across opening switch contacts is sufficient to ionize the air molecules across the tiny gap between the contacts as the switch is opened, forming a gas plasma, also known as an electric arc. The pla...

A switch may be directly manipulated by a human as a control signal to a system, such as a computer keyboard button, or to control power **flow** in a circuit, such as a light switch. Automatically operated switches can be used to control the motions of machines, for example, to indicate that a garage door has reached its full open position or...
