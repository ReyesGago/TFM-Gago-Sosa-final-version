1. ...ile this was the birth, there have been a large number of further developments since then. There are many types and techniques of electron diffraction. The most common approach is where the electrons **transmit** through a thin sample, from 1 nm to 100 nm (10 to 1000 atoms thick), where the results depending upon how the atoms are arranged in the material, for instance a single crystal, many crystals or diffe...

The development of digital data communications methods made it possible to digitize voice and **transmit** it as real-time data across computer networks and the Internet, giving rise to the field of Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, also known as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). VoIP has proven to be...

...from 1971 to 1988. Since the wavelength of VLF radio signals is very large (a frequency of 10 kHz corresponds to a wavelength of ), Siple Station had an antenna that was long. The antenna was used to **transmit** VLF radio signals into Earth's magnetosphere, to be detected in Canada. It was possible to inject these signals into the magnetosphere, since the ionosphere is transparent to these low frequencies. W...

...global VoIP market in October 2021 was $85.2 billion with a projection of $102.5 billion by 2026. IP telephony uses high-bandwidth Internet connections and specialized customer premises equipment to **transmit** telephone calls via the Internet, or any modern private data network. The customer equipment may be an analog telephone adapter (ATA) which translates the signals of a conventional analog telephone;...

1.  ...xclusion of others. The most extreme example of digital spread-spectrum signalling to date is ultra-wideband (UWB), which proposes the use of large sections of the radio spectrum at low amplitudes to **transmit** high-bandwidth digital data. UWB, if used exclusively, would enable very efficient use of the spectrum, but users of non-UWB technology are not yet prepared to share the spectrum with the new system...
2. ...ion line theory (also known as the "telegrapher's equations"), which had the effect of increasing the transmission rate over transatlantic cables by a factor of ten. It originally took ten minutes to **transmit** each character, and this immediately improved to one character per minute. Closely related to this was his discovery that telephone transmission could be greatly improved by placing electrical induct...
3. ...at low Earth orbit. Rapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can produce geomagnetically induced currents in pipelines. This can cause multiple problems for pipeline engineers. Pipeline flow meters can **transmit** erroneous flow information and the corrosion rate of the pipeline can be dramatically increased. Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere allow adequate protection at ground level, but astronauts are sub...

1. ...a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity. In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to **transmit** power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were...
2. ...efficiency. A three-wire three-phase circuit is usually more economical than an equivalent two-wire single-phase circuit at the same line-to-ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to **transmit** a given amount of electrical power. Three-phase power is mainly used directly to power large induction motors, other electric motors and other heavy loads. Small loads often use only a two-wire singl...
3. ...most with electric power transmission. Alternating current is normally preferred as its voltage may be easily stepped up by a transformer in order to minimize resistive loss in the conductors used to **transmit** power over great distances; another set of transformers is required to step it back down to safer or more usable voltage levels at destination. Power transmission is usually performed with overhead l...
