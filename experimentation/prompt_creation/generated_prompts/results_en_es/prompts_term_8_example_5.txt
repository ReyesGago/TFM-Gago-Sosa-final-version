1. ...arge is identical to the charge of a proton, but with the opposite sign. The electron is commonly symbolized by , and the positron is symbolized by . The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum or **spin** of . This property is usually stated by referring to the electron as a spin-1/2 particle. For such particles the spin magnitude is , while the result of the measurement of a projection of the spin on...
2. ...pposed to fire, the flyweights are released by the action of the body contacting the trigger ramp. This allows the spring to unwind giving the rotating magnet a rapid rotation and letting the magneto **spin** at such a speed to produce a spark. In the late 1890s, English engineer Frederick Richard Simms collaborated with the German engineer Robert Bosch, and his staff of Arnold Zähringer, Young Rall, and...

...it, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment. This is analogous to the rotation of the Earth on its axis as it orbits the Sun. The intrinsic angular momentum became known as **spin**, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting. In his 1924 dissertation "" (R...

...entary demonstration of jet power dates back to the aeolipile, a device described by Hero of Alexandria in 1st-century Egypt. This device directed steam power through two nozzles to cause a sphere to **spin** rapidly on its axis. It was seen as a curiosity. Meanwhile, practical applications of the turbine can be seen in the water wheel and the windmill.  Historians have further traced the theoretical orig...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where spin translates as spin:
1. ...es because they have no known components or substructure. The electron's mass is approximately that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (**spin**) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, . Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, per the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all elementa...
2. ...eaking the picture is the following: An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite **spin**, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very stro...
3. ...insic magnetic moment along its spin axis. It is approximately equal to one Bohr magneton,=\frac{e\hbar}{2m_{\mathrm{e}}}</math>}} which is a physical constant that is equal to The orientation of the **spin** with respect to the momentum of the electron defines the property of elementary particles known as helicity. The electron has no known substructure. Nevertheless, in condensed matter physics, spin–ch...

1. ...tricity, these being natural coal, gas and nuclear forms of thermal generation. More recently solar and wind have become large scale. Natural gas is ignited to create pressurised gas which is used to **spin** turbines to generate electricity. Natural gas plants use a gas turbine where natural gas is added along with oxygen which in turn combusts and expands through the turbine to force a generator to spin...
2. ...ecause it is "near to online". The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is: For example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that **spin** down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks (MAID), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in tape libraries, are nearline...
3. ...work for the design team. Most chips will go through a series of iterations, called "spins", in which errors are detected and fixed after testing the first article. Many different factors can cause a **spin**, including: The roots of the term can be traced back to the time when paper tape and later magnetic tape reels were loaded with the final electronic files used to create the photomask at the factory....
