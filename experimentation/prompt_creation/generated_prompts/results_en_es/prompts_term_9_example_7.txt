1. ...tum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting **state**. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of "perfect conductivity" in classical physics. In a semiconductor it is someti...
2. ...media), formed once (write once media) or reversible (recordable or read/write media). The following forms are in common use : Magneto-optical disc storage is optical disc storage where the magnetic **state** on a ferromagnetic surface stores information. The information is read optically and written by combining magnetic and optical methods. Magneto-optical disc storage is "non-volatile", "sequential acc...

In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or **state**. This is responsible for the Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons.

At rest, a particle will be in one of the minimum equilibrium positions, because that corresponds to the **state** of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualized as a barrier between them. A system can transition from one state of minimal energy to the other if it is given enough activation energy to penetrate t...

2. ...crystalline semiconductors, electrons can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of levels of energy). Energetically, these bands are located between the energy of the ground state, the **state** in which electrons are tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, the latter describing the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material...
3. ...that contains enough mobile electrons and positive ions to make it an electrical conductor. In the process, it forms a light emitting conductive path, such as a spark, arc or lightning. Plasma is the **state** of matter where some of the electrons in a gas are stripped or "ionized" from their molecules or atoms. A plasma can be formed by high temperature, or by application of a high electric or alternating...

These are distinct from "digital storage oscilloscopes" which rely on solid **state** digital memory to store the image. Where a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long...
