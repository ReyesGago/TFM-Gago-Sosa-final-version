1. ...ces is at any given point proportional to the magnitude of its magnetic moment. In addition, when the magnet is put into an external magnetic field, produced by a different source, it is subject to a **torque** tending to orient the magnetic moment parallel to the field. The amount of this torque is proportional both to the magnetic moment and the external field. A magnet may also be subject to a force driv...
2. ...d regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back EMF results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional **torque** to balance the load. In AC machines, it is sometimes useful to consider a back EMF source within the machine; this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on VFDs. Mot...

...stem. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have predictable characteristics for speed, **torque**, and power. The speed/torque curve is important and is high ratio for a servomotor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are important; these factors limit pe...

...input current, formula_7 is output torque, and formula_23 is output angular velocity. It is possible to derive analytically the point of maximum efficiency. It is typically at less than 1/2 the stall **torque**. Various national regulatory authorities have enacted legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher-efficiency motors. Electric motors have efficiencies ranging from around 15%-20% for s...

1. ...ld lines point away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge. When placed in a homogeneous electric or magnetic field, equal but opposite forces arise on each side of the dipole creating a **torque** }: for an electric dipole moment p (in coulomb-meters), or for a magnetic dipole moment m (in ampere-square meters). The resulting torque will tend to align the dipole with the applied field, which i...
2. ...use it depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and their distance and direction relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic **torque**. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field of the other. To understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the "magnetic pole model" given above. I...

In other words, The field can also be defined by the **torque** on a magnetic dipole, . The SI unit of is tesla (symbol: T). The Gaussian-cgs unit of is the gauss (symbol: G).

Programmable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or **torque** control. Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be integrated with PLC so that G-code (involving a CNC machine) can be used to instruct machine movements. These are for small machines and...
2. ...plying current to the rotor. The windings on the rotor are connected to the commutator segments. The commutator reverses the current direction in the rotor windings with each half turn (180°), so the **torque** applied to the rotor is always in the same direction. Without this reversal, the direction of torque on each rotor winding would reverse with each half turn, stopping the rotor. Commutated motors hav...
3. ...ectrical energy into mechanical energy. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of **torque** applied on the motor's shaft. An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in reverse, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Electric motors can b...
