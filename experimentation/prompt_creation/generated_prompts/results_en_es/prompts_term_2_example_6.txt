1. ...overed that the force required for the rotation of a copper disc becomes greater when it is made to rotate with its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disc at the same time becoming heated by the **eddy current** induced in the metal. The first use of eddy current for non-destructive testing occurred in 1879 when David E. Hughes used the principles to conduct metallurgical sorting tests. A magnet induces circ...
2. ...power losses. Therefore, solid iron cores are not used in transformers or inductors, they are replaced by laminated or powdered iron cores, or nonconductive cores like ferrite. In order to reduce the **eddy current** losses mentioned above, most low frequency power transformers and inductors use laminated cores, made of stacks of thin sheets of silicon steel: Laminated magnetic cores are made of stacks of thin ir...

2. ...force (EMF) in the sheet, in accordance with Faraday's law of induction, exerting a force on the electrons in the sheet, causing a counterclockwise circular current formula_6 in the sheet. This is an **eddy current**. Similarly, the part of the sheet moving away from the edge of the magnet (the right side) experiences a decrease in magnetic flux density formula_7, inducing a second eddy current, this time in a cl...
3. ...ter the suppression of eddy currents. The conversion of input energy to heat is not always undesirable, however, as there are some practical applications. One is in the brakes of some trains known as **eddy current** brakes. During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field from an electromagnet, generating eddy currents in the wheels. This eddy current is formed by the movement of the wheels. So,...

2. ...roportional to the square of the current, breaking a large core into narrow laminations reduces the power losses drastically. From this, it can be seen that the thinner the laminations, the lower the **eddy current** losses. A small addition of silicon to iron (around 3%) results in a dramatic increase of the resistivity of the metal, up to four times higher. The higher resistivity reduces the eddy currents, so s...
3. ...equencies, as the eddy currents are mostly restricted to within the individual grains. Coating of the particles with an insulating layer, or their separation with a thin layer of a binder, lowers the **eddy current** losses. Presence of larger particles can degrade high-frequency performance. Permeability is influenced by the spacing between the grains, which form distributed air gap; the less gap, the higher per...
