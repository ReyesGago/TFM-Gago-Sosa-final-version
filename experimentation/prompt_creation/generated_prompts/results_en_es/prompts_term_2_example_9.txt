So, by Lenz's law, the magnetic field formed by the **eddy current** will oppose its cause. Thus the wheel will face a force opposing the initial movement of the wheel. The faster the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as the train slows the br...

From this, it can be seen that the thinner the laminations, the lower the **eddy current** losses. A small addition of silicon to iron (around 3%) results in a dramatic increase of the resistivity of the metal, up to four times higher. The higher resistivity reduces the eddy currents, so s...

This effect is employed in **eddy current** brakes which are used to stop rotating power tools quickly when they are turned off. The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material. Thus e...
