The Curie temperature itself is a critical point, where the magnetic susceptibility is theoretically infinite and, although there is no net magnetization, domain-like **spin** correlations fluctuate at all length scales. The study of ferromagnetic phase transitions, especially via the simplified Ising spin model, had an important impact on the development of statistical ph...
2. ...n a front-loading machine. Manufacturers have devised several ways to control the motion of the agitator during the wash and rinse separately from the high-speed rotation of the drum required for the **spin** cycle. While a top-loading washing machine could use a universal motor or DC brushless motor, it is conventional for top-loading washing machines to use more expensive, heavy, and potentially more el...

...etic north pole is the "south" pole (south-seeking pole) of its dipole moment and vice versa. The only known mechanisms for the creation of magnetic dipoles are by current loops or quantum-mechanical **spin** since the existence of magnetic monopoles has never been experimentally demonstrated. A "physical dipole" consists of two equal and opposite point charges: in the literal sense, two poles. Its field...

...drives and failure of electronic components on flash storage. Impending failure on hard disk drives is estimable using S.M.A.R.T. diagnostic data that includes the hours of operation and the count of **spin**-ups, though its reliability is disputed. Flash storage may experience downspiking transfer rates as a result of accumulating errors, which the flash memory controller attempts to correct. The health...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where spin translates as spin:
1. ...eaking the picture is the following: An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite **spin**, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very stro...
2. ...es because they have no known components or substructure. The electron's mass is approximately that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (**spin**) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, . Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, per the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all elementa...
3. ...nce to be determined. In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, **spin** and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle prop...

1. ...ecause it is "near to online". The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is: For example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that **spin** down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks (MAID), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in tape libraries, are nearline...
2. ...tricity, these being natural coal, gas and nuclear forms of thermal generation. More recently solar and wind have become large scale. Natural gas is ignited to create pressurised gas which is used to **spin** turbines to generate electricity. Natural gas plants use a gas turbine where natural gas is added along with oxygen which in turn combusts and expands through the turbine to force a generator to spin...

The machine would fill with only a small amount of water and the two wash plates would **spin**, tumbling the load within it, mimicking the action of a front-loading washer in a vertical-axis design. In 2006, Sanyo introduced the "world-first" (as of February 2, 2006, with regards to home use d...
