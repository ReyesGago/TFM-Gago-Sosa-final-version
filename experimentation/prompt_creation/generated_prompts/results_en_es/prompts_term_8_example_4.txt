1. ...it, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment. This is analogous to the rotation of the Earth on its axis as it orbits the Sun. The intrinsic angular momentum became known as **spin**, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting. In his 1924 dissertation "" (R...
2. ...entary demonstration of jet power dates back to the aeolipile, a device described by Hero of Alexandria in 1st-century Egypt. This device directed steam power through two nozzles to cause a sphere to **spin** rapidly on its axis. It was seen as a curiosity. Meanwhile, practical applications of the turbine can be seen in the water wheel and the windmill.  Historians have further traced the theoretical orig...

...omentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their **spin** quantum number. Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer i...

The mechanism was now enclosed within a cabinet, and more attention was paid to electrical and mechanical safety. **Spin** dryers were introduced to replace the dangerous power mangle/wringers of the day. By 1940, 60% of the 25,000,000 wired homes in the United States had an electric washing machine. Many of these machin...

2. ...eaking the picture is the following: An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite **spin**, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very stro...
3. ...he spin with respect to the momentum of the electron defines the property of elementary particles known as helicity. The electron has no known substructure. Nevertheless, in condensed matter physics, **spin**â€“charge separation can occur in some materials. In such cases, electrons 'split' into three independent particles, the spinon, the orbiton and the holon (or chargon). The electron can always be theore...

2. ...ecause it is "near to online". The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is: For example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that **spin** down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks (MAID), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in tape libraries, are nearline...

By using a transmission gearbox, the rotational inertia of the flywheel can be used to directly start up a diesel engine, and once running, the diesel engine can be used to directly **spin** the flywheel. Multiple flywheels can likewise be connected in parallel through mechanical countershafts, without the need for separate motors and generators for each flywheel. They are normally desig...
