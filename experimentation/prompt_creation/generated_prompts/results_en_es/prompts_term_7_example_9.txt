Translate these contexts into Spanish:
1. ...ion is the removal of a biological structure or functionality. Genetic ablation is another term for gene silencing, in which gene expression is abolished through the alteration or deletion of genetic **sequence** information. In cell ablation, individual cells in a population or culture are destroyed or removed. Both can be used as experimental tools, as in loss-of-function experiments. In medicine, ablation...
2. ...th the PLC connected via a communication interface. A PLC works in a program scan cycle, where it executes its program repeatedly. The simplest scan cycle consists of 3 steps: The program follows the **sequence** of instructions. It typically takes a time span of tens of milliseconds for the processor to evaluate all the instructions and update the status of all outputs. If the system contains remote I/O—for...

...temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given "B-V" index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main **sequence** and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body "U-B" index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with...

...certain loads. Variable-frequency drives and digital phase converters use power electronic devices to synthesize a balanced three-phase supply from single-phase input power. Verification of the phase **sequence** in a circuit is of considerable practical importance. Two sources of three-phase power must not be connected in parallel unless they have the same phase sequence, for example, when connecting a gener...

1. ...tector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded. A spectrograph is sometimes called polychromator, as an analogy to monochromator. The star spectral classification and discovery of the main **sequence**, Hubble's law and the Hubble sequence were all made with spectrographs that used photographic paper. James Webb Space Telescope contains both a near-infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec) and a mid-infrared...
2. ...mage to contacts. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which ionizes more gas molecules (where the degree of ionization is determined by temperature), and as per this **sequence**: solid-liquid-gas-plasma; the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium; the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the atoms, molecules, ion...
3. ...will exist at a particular potential relative to the anode, which is dependent on the quantity of CaO present in CaCl. The electrocalciothermic reduction mechanism may be represented by the following **sequence** of reactions, where "M" represents a metal to be reduced (typically titanium). When this reaction takes place on its own, it is referred to as the "calciothermic reduction" (or, more generally, an ex...

Presently, there are three distinct categories of logic analyzers available on the market: A logic analyzer can be triggered on a complicated **sequence** of digital events, then capture a large amount of digital data from the system under test (SUT). When logic analyzers first came into use, it was common to attach several hundred "clips" to a digital...

Progressive scanning, the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in **sequence**, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning, in effect, doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1...
3. ...es the Voyager probes and the Galileo probes, among others. Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined **sequence** of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in an...
