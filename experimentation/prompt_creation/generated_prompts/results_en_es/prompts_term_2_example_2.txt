...ddy current brakes use the drag force created by eddy currents as a brake to slow or stop moving objects. Since there is no contact with a brake shoe or drum, there is no mechanical wear. However, an **eddy current** brake cannot provide a "holding" torque and so may be used in combination with mechanical brakes, for example, on overhead cranes. Another application is on some roller coasters, where heavy copper p...

...hors explained In typical experiments, students measure the slower time of fall of the magnet through a copper tube compared with a cardboard tube, and may use an oscilloscope to observe the pulse of **eddy current** induced in a loop of wire wound around the pipe when the magnet falls through. Phase synchronization Phase synchronization is the process by which two or more cyclic signals tend to oscillate with a...

1. ...e, a nearby conductive surface will exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion, due to eddy currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field. This effect is employed in **eddy current** brakes which are used to stop rotating power tools quickly when they are turned off. The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material. Thus e...
2. ...minimize them. Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in induction heating furnaces and equipment, and to detect cracks and flaws in metal parts using eddy-current testing instruments. The term "**eddy current**" comes from analogous currents seen in water in fluid dynamics, causing localised areas of turbulence known as "eddies" giving rise to persistent vortices. Somewhat analogously, eddy currents can tak...
3. ...overed that the force required for the rotation of a copper disc becomes greater when it is made to rotate with its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disc at the same time becoming heated by the **eddy current** induced in the metal. The first use of eddy current for non-destructive testing occurred in 1879 when David E. Hughes used the principles to conduct metallurgical sorting tests. A magnet induces circ...

1. ...ted the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments; In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of **eddy current** losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores. Transformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers. They also popularized the word 'transformer'...
2. ...and create error in kilowatt-hour metering systems and billing revenue. The presence of current harmonics in a transformer also result in larger eddy currents in the magnetic core of the transformer. **Eddy current** losses generally increase as the square of the frequency, lowering the transformer's efficiency, dissipating additional heat, and reducing its service life. Negative-sequence harmonics (5th, 11th, 17...
3. ...power losses. Therefore, solid iron cores are not used in transformers or inductors, they are replaced by laminated or powdered iron cores, or nonconductive cores like ferrite. In order to reduce the **eddy current** losses mentioned above, most low frequency power transformers and inductors use laminated cores, made of stacks of thin sheets of silicon steel: Laminated magnetic cores are made of stacks of thin ir...
