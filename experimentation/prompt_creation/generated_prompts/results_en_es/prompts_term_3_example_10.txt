Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity. The **efficiency** of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent. As transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to tabulate no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on....

...energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip **efficiency** is greater than 95%. Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the high cost of superconducting wire, SMES is currently used for short duration energy storage. Therefore, SMES is most commo...

Power-factor correction increases the power factor of a load, improving **efficiency** for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with a low power factor (such as induction motors) can be corrected with a passive network of capacitors or inductors. Non-linear loa...

The phase shifts are used by Fresnel's invention, the Fresnel rhomb, to modify polarization. The **efficiency** of the total internal reflection is exploited by optical fibers (used in telecommunications cables and in image-forming fiberscopes), and by reflective prisms, such as image-erecting Porro/roof prism...

3. ...ectrons to be freed from the magnetic field, and they drift towards the anode. About 20–30% of the discharge current is an electron current, which does not produce thrust, thus limiting the energetic **efficiency** of the thruster; the other 70–80% of the current is in the ions. Because the majority of electrons are trapped in the Hall current, they have a long residence time inside the thruster and are able to...

A three-phase induction motor has a simple design, inherently high starting torque and high **efficiency**. Such motors are applied in industry for many applications. A three-phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor of the same voltage class and rating, and single-phase AC mot...
