1. ...density of free charge; formula_26 is the polarization density; formula_27 is the density of free current; and formula_28 is the magnetization density. In this way, the Lorentz force can explain the **torque** applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field. The density of the associated power is formula_29 The above-mentioned formulae use the conventions for the definition of the electric and magnetic...
2. ...second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines. Impulse turbines are most efficient for use in cases where the flow is low and the inlet pressure is high.  Reaction turbines develop **torque** by reacting to the gas or fluid's pressure or mass. The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid...

...rought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a "magnetic **torque**" on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field. Mat...

...t 100 kW are used in electric vehicles. They also find use in electric model aircraft. The switched reluctance motor (SRM) has no brushes or permanent magnets, and the rotor has no electric currents. **Torque** comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator. The rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator, while the stator field windings are sequentially energi...

1. ...example, the needle of a compass has the lowest magnetic potential energy when it is aligned with the north and south poles of the Earth's magnetic field. If the needle is moved by an outside force, **torque** is exerted on the magnetic dipole of the needle by the Earth's magnetic field, causing it to move back into alignment. The magnetic potential energy of the needle is highest when its field is in the...
2. ...stem. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have predictable characteristics for speed, **torque**, and power. The speed/torque curve is important and is high ratio for a servomotor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are important; these factors limit pe...
3. ...hat is free to rotate. This magnetic torque tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field. Mathematically, the **torque** on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment of the magnet: formula_8 where × represents the vector cross product. This equation includes all of the..

Mechanical power may be transmitted directly using a solid structure such as a driveshaft; transmission gears can adjust the amount of **torque** or force vs. speed in much the same way an electrical transformer adjusts voltage vs current. Factories were fitted with overhead line shafts providing rotary power. Short line-shaft systems were des...

It is typically at less than 1/2 the stall **torque**. Various national regulatory authorities have enacted legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher-efficiency motors. Electric motors have efficiencies ranging from around 15%-20% for s...
3. ...power that would otherwise be wasted into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator. WRIMs are used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires high starting **torque** across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current...
