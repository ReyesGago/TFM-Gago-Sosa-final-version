Translate these contexts into Spanish taking into account that transmission line translates as línea de transmisión in Physics > Electro-magnetism, like the following example shows:
...he analysis of lossless lines provides an accurate approximation for real transmission lines that simplifies the mathematics considered in modeling transmission lines. A lossless line is defined as a **transmission line** that has no line resistance and no dielectric loss. This would imply that the conductors act like perfect conductors and the dielectric acts like a perfect dielectric. For a lossless line, and are bo...

...pacity lines. Adding transmission lines is difficult due to cost, permit intervals, and local opposition. Reconductoring has the potential to double the amount of electricity that can travel across a **transmission line**.  A 2024 report found the United States behind countries like Belgium and the Netherlands in adoption of this technique to accommodate electrification and renewable energy. In April 2022, the Biden A...

1. ...fficient and transmission constant. If the plural is used, it suggests that "α" and "β" are being referenced separately but collectively as in transmission parameters, propagation parameters, etc. In **transmission line** theory, "α" and "β" are counted among the "secondary coefficients", the term "secondary" being used to contrast to the "primary line coefficients". The primary coefficients are the physical propertie...
2. ...prism case, some light leaks out at the prism corners). An "acoustic waveguide" is a physical structure for guiding sound waves. Sound in an acoustic waveguide behaves like electromagnetic waves on a **transmission line**. Waves on a string, like the ones in a tin can telephone, are a simple example of an acoustic waveguide. Another example are pressure waves in the pipes of an organ. The term "acoustic waveguide" is...
3. ...ive to the input impedance of the amplifier) in order to account for the added noise observed following amplification. An RF receiver system is typically made up of an antenna and a receiver, and the **transmission line**(s) that connect the two together. Each of these is a source of additive noise. The additive noise in a receiving system can be of thermal origin (thermal noise) or can be from other external or inter...

Optical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a **transmission line**, in the overhead shield wires. These cables are known as optical ground wire ("OPGW"). Sometimes a standalone cable is used, all-dielectric self-supporting ("ADSS") cable, attached to the transmissio...

Australia has one unregulated or market interconnector – Basslink – between Tasmania and...

Communication systems associated with a transmission project may use: Rarely, and for short distances, pilot-wires are strung along the **transmission line** path. Leased circuits from common carriers are not preferred since availability is not under control of the operator. Transmission lines can be used to carry data: this is called power-line carrier,...
