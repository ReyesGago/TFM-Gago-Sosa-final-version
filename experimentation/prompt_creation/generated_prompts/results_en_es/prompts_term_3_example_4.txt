...energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip **efficiency** is greater than 95%. Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the high cost of superconducting wire, SMES is currently used for short duration energy storage. Therefore, SMES is most commo...

...d energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers with a low power factor. Power-factor correction increases the power factor of a load, improving **efficiency** for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with a low power factor (such as induction motors) can be corrected with a passive network of capacitors or inductors. Non-linear loa...

1. ...xenon Hall thrusters. , Hall-effect thrusters ranged in input power levels from 1.35 to 10 kilowatts and had exhaust velocities of 10–50 kilometers per second, with thrust of 40–600 millinewtons and **efficiency** in the range of 45–60 percent. The applications of Hall-effect thrusters include control of the orientation and position of orbiting satellites and use as a main propulsion engine for medium-size rob...
2. ...s resistance dissipates some of the reactive energy. The quality factor (or "Q") of an inductor is the ratio of its inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and is a measure of its **efficiency**. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal inductor. High Q inductors are used with capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and rec...

1. ...to each of the other wires. Because it is an AC system, it allows the voltages to be easily stepped up using transformers to high voltage for transmission and back down for distribution, giving high **efficiency**. A three-wire three-phase circuit is usually more economical than an equivalent two-wire single-phase circuit at the same line-to-ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit a...

A standard definition is used to assess how different things change engine **efficiency** and also to allow comparisons to be made between different engines. This definition is called specific fuel consumption, or how much fuel is needed to produce one unit of thrust. For example, it will...

Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity. The **efficiency** of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent. As transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to tabulate no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on....
