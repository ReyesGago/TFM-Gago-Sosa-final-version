1. ...ice on record is thought to be the ancient Ktesibios's water clock in Alexandria, Egypt, around the third century BCE. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water **flow** from that vessel. This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols captured the city in 1258 CE. A variety of automatic devic...
2. ...istance rises and the current decreases to a steady-state value. A switch designed for an incandescent lamp load can withstand this inrush current. "Wetting current" is the minimum current needing to **flow** through a mechanical switch while it is operated to break through any film of oxidation that may have been deposited on the switch contacts. The film of oxidation occurs often in areas with high humi...

...ula_22 is the speed of light and ∇· denotes the divergence of a tensor field. Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the energy flux (**flow** of "energy" per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism for more details. The density of powe...

For large conductors (more than a few centimetres in diameter), much of the current **flow** is concentrated near the surface due to the skin effect. The center of the conductor carries little current but contributes weight and cost. Thus, multiple parallel cables (called bundle conductors)...

2. ...om to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation: formula_11 where Typically, electric charges in solids **flow** slowly. For example, in a copper wire of cross-section 0.5 mm, carrying a current of 5 A, the drift velocity of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example,...
3. ...ons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor. For a steady **flow** of charge through a surface, the current "I" (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation: formula_5 where "Q" is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time "t". If...

When the power being switched is sufficiently large, the electron **flow** across opening switch contacts is sufficient to ionize the air molecules across the tiny gap between the contacts as the switch is opened, forming a gas plasma, also known as an electric arc. The pla...
3. ...urrent may be specified for a given switch design. In electronics, switches are classified according to the arrangement of their contacts. A pair of contacts is said to be ""closed"" when current can **flow** from one to the other. When the contacts are separated by an insulating air gap, they are said to be ""open"", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages. The terms ""make"" for closure...
