1. ...n differential and integral form follows likewise. The line integrals and curls are analogous to quantities in classical fluid dynamics: the circulation of a fluid is the line integral of the fluid's **flow** velocity field around a closed loop, and the vorticity of the fluid is the curl of the velocity field. The invariance of charge can be derived as a corollary of Maxwell's equations. The left-hand sid...
2. ...stant sources. Because of the economic benefits of load sharing, wide area transmission grids may span countries and even continents. Interconnections between producers and consumers enables power to **flow** even if some links are inoperative. The slowly varying portion of demand is known as the "base load" and is generally served by large facilities with constant operating costs, termed firm power. Such...

Translate these contexts into Spanish taking into account that flow translates as caudal in Physics > Electro-magnetism, like the following example shows:
...nature of sources of plasma and momentum, the period of the object's spin, the nature of the axis about which the object spins, the axis of the magnetic dipole, and the magnitude and direction of the **flow** of solar wind. The planetary distance where the magnetosphere can withstand the solar wind pressure is called the Chapmanâ€“Ferraro distance. This is usefully modeled by the formula wherein formula_1 r...

...ctive distance for DC transmission was . For AC it was , though US transmission lines are substantially shorter. In any AC line, conductor inductance and capacitance can be significant. Currents that **flow** solely in reaction to these properties, (which together with the resistance define the impedance) constitute reactive power flow, which transmits no power to the load. These reactive currents, howeve...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where flow translates as caudal:
1. ...e general gain equation approaches a linear asymptote: Superconducting magnetic energy storage Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the **flow** of direct current in a superconducting coil that has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. This use of superconducting coils to store magnetic ene...
2. ...ons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor. For a steady **flow** of charge through a surface, the current "I" (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation: formula_5 where "Q" is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time "t". If...
3. ...ice on record is thought to be the ancient Ktesibios's water clock in Alexandria, Egypt, around the third century BCE. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water **flow** from that vessel. This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols captured the city in 1258 CE. A variety of automatic devic...

Examples in Technological Sciences > Electrical technology and engineering, where flow translates as circular:
1. ...ators require reliable communications to manage the grid and associated generation and distribution facilities. Fault-sensing protective relays at each end of the line must communicate to monitor the **flow** of power so that faulted conductors or equipment can be quickly de-energized and the balance of the system restored. Protection of the transmission line from short circuits and other faults is usuall...
2. ...urrent may be specified for a given switch design. In electronics, switches are classified according to the arrangement of their contacts. A pair of contacts is said to be ""closed"" when current can **flow** from one to the other. When the contacts are separated by an insulating air gap, they are said to be ""open"", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages. The terms ""make"" for closure...
3. ...istance rises and the current decreases to a steady-state value. A switch designed for an incandescent lamp load can withstand this inrush current. "Wetting current" is the minimum current needing to **flow** through a mechanical switch while it is operated to break through any film of oxidation that may have been deposited on the switch contacts. The film of oxidation occurs often in areas with high humi...
