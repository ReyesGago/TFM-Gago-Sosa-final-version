1. ...energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip **efficiency** is greater than 95%. Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the high cost of superconducting wire, SMES is currently used for short duration energy storage. Therefore, SMES is most commo...
2. ...d energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers with a low power factor. Power-factor correction increases the power factor of a load, improving **efficiency** for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with a low power factor (such as induction motors) can be corrected with a passive network of capacitors or inductors. Non-linear loa...

...ectrons to be freed from the magnetic field, and they drift towards the anode. About 20–30% of the discharge current is an electron current, which does not produce thrust, thus limiting the energetic **efficiency** of the thruster; the other 70–80% of the current is in the ions. Because the majority of electrons are trapped in the Hall current, they have a long residence time inside the thruster and are able to...

...o 25 kV). Finally, at the point of use, the energy is transformed to end-user voltage (100 to 4160 volts). High-voltage power transmission allows for lesser resistive losses over long distances. This **efficiency** delivers a larger proportion of the generated power to the loads. In a simplified model, the grid delivers electricity from an ideal voltage source with voltage formula_3, delivering a power formula_...

The mass use efficiency of the thruster is thus around 90%, while the discharge current **efficiency** is around 70%, for a combined thruster efficiency of around 63% (= 90% × 70%). Modern Hall thrusters have achieved efficiencies as high as 75% through advanced designs. Compared to chemical rockets,...

Because it is an AC system, it allows the voltages to be easily stepped up using transformers to high voltage for transmission and back down for distribution, giving high **efficiency**. A three-wire three-phase circuit is usually more economical than an equivalent two-wire single-phase circuit at the same line-to-ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit a...
