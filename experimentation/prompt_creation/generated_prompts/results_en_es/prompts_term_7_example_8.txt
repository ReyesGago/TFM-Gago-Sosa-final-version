1. ...e systems. Physically, in a three phase system, a positive sequence set of currents produces a normal rotating field, a negative sequence set produces a field with the opposite rotation, and the zero **sequence** set produces a field that oscillates but does not rotate between phase windings. Since these effects can be detected physically with sequence filters, the mathematical tool became the basis for the d...
2. ...ional life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired **sequence** of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in...

...temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given "B-V" index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main **sequence** and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body "U-B" index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with...

...certain loads. Variable-frequency drives and digital phase converters use power electronic devices to synthesize a balanced three-phase supply from single-phase input power. Verification of the phase **sequence** in a circuit is of considerable practical importance. Two sources of three-phase power must not be connected in parallel unless they have the same phase sequence, for example, when connecting a gener...

Physically, in a three phase system, a positive **sequence** set of currents produces a normal rotating field, a negative sequence set produces a field with the opposite rotation, and the zero sequence set produces a field that oscillates but does not rotate b...
2. ...n be substituted for for all photon momentum terms which arise in course of the derivation below. The derivation which appears in Compton's paper is more terse, but follows the same logic in the same **sequence** as the following derivation. The conservation of energy formula_18 merely equates the sum of energies before and after scattering. Compton postulated that photons carry momentum; thus from the conser...

However, modern cosmology recognizes the Kelvin period in the early life of a star, during which it shines from gravitational energy (correctly calculated by Kelvin) before fusion and the main **sequence** begins. In the winter of 1860–61 Kelvin slipped on the ice while curling near his home at Netherhall and fractured his leg, causing him to miss the 1861 Manchester meeting of the British Association...

1. ...on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers. On an automated production line, a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded, glued, painted and finally assembled at a **sequence** of robot stations. Industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods, for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and pl...

Though W-CDMA does use a direct-**sequence** CDMA transmission technique like CDMA2000, W-CDMA is not simply a wideband version of CDMA2000 and differs in many aspects from CDMA2000. From an engineering point of view, W-CDMA provides a differen...

Two sources of three-phase power must not be connected in parallel unless they have the same phase **sequence**, for example, when connecting a generator to an energized distribution network or when connecting two transformers in parallel. Otherwise, the interconnection will behave like a short circuit, and ex...
