Translate these contexts into Spanish:
1. ...at low Earth orbit. Rapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can produce geomagnetically induced currents in pipelines. This can cause multiple problems for pipeline engineers. Pipeline flow meters can **transmit** erroneous flow information and the corrosion rate of the pipeline can be dramatically increased. Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere allow adequate protection at ground level, but astronauts are sub...
2. ...most with electric power transmission. Alternating current is normally preferred as its voltage may be easily stepped up by a transformer in order to minimize resistive loss in the conductors used to **transmit** power over great distances; another set of transformers is required to step it back down to safer or more usable voltage levels at destination. Power transmission is usually performed with overhead l...

Translate these contexts into Spanish taking into account that transmit translates as transmitir in Physics > Electro-magnetism, like the following example shows:
...magnetic field, Faraday rotation angles of over 0.78 rad (45°) can be achieved. This allows the construction of Faraday rotators, which are the principal component of Faraday isolators, devices which **transmit** light in only one direction. The Faraday effect can, however, be observed and measured in a Terbium-doped glass with Verdet constant as low as (≈ for 632 nm light). Similar isolators are constructed...
And as transportar in Technological Sciences > Electrical technology and engineering, like the following example shows:
...ystems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to **transmit** AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and "step down" (reduce) the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where transmit translates as transmitir:
1. ...ion line theory (also known as the "telegrapher's equations"), which had the effect of increasing the transmission rate over transatlantic cables by a factor of ten. It originally took ten minutes to **transmit** each character, and this immediately improved to one character per minute. Closely related to this was his discovery that telephone transmission could be greatly improved by placing electrical induct...
2. ...transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to **transmit** large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications. At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no...
3. ...up velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling instantaneously or backwards in time. None of these options allow information to be transmitted faster than "c". It is impossible to **transmit** information with a light pulse any faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the front velocity). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always equal to "c".  It is p...

Examples in Technological Sciences > Electrical technology and engineering, where transmit translates as transportar:
1. ...efficiency. A three-wire three-phase circuit is usually more economical than an equivalent two-wire single-phase circuit at the same line-to-ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to **transmit** a given amount of electrical power. Three-phase power is mainly used directly to power large induction motors, other electric motors and other heavy loads. Small loads often use only a two-wire singl...
2. ...band attenuation. On shared-antenna sites, the bandpass duplexer variety is greatly preferred because this virtually eliminates interference between transmitters and receivers by removing out-of-band **transmit** emissions and considerably improving the selectivity of receivers. Most professionally engineered sites ban the use of notch duplexers and insist on bandpass duplexers for this reason. "Note 1:" A du...
3. ...ula_22 should be replaced with formula_23 (the line length) in all parameters of the transmission matrix. This model applies the Telegrapher's equations. High-voltage direct current (HVDC) is used to **transmit** large amounts of power over long distances or for interconnections between asynchronous grids. When electrical energy is transmitted over very long distances, the power lost in AC transmission become...
