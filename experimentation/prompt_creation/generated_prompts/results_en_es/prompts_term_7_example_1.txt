1. ...tector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded. A spectrograph is sometimes called polychromator, as an analogy to monochromator. The star spectral classification and discovery of the main **sequence**, Hubble's law and the Hubble sequence were all made with spectrographs that used photographic paper. James Webb Space Telescope contains both a near-infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec) and a mid-infrared...
2. ...g relationships between many signals in a digital system. Presently, there are three distinct categories of logic analyzers available on the market: A logic analyzer can be triggered on a complicated **sequence** of digital events, then capture a large amount of digital data from the system under test (SUT). When logic analyzers first came into use, it was common to attach several hundred "clips" to a digital...

...ion is the removal of a biological structure or functionality. Genetic ablation is another term for gene silencing, in which gene expression is abolished through the alteration or deletion of genetic **sequence** information. In cell ablation, individual cells in a population or culture are destroyed or removed. Both can be used as experimental tools, as in loss-of-function experiments. In medicine, ablation...

...th the PLC connected via a communication interface. A PLC works in a program scan cycle, where it executes its program repeatedly. The simplest scan cycle consists of 3 steps: The program follows the **sequence** of instructions. It typically takes a time span of tens of milliseconds for the processor to evaluate all the instructions and update the status of all outputs. If the system contains remote I/O—for...

1. ...e systems. Physically, in a three phase system, a positive sequence set of currents produces a normal rotating field, a negative sequence set produces a field with the opposite rotation, and the zero **sequence** set produces a field that oscillates but does not rotate between phase windings. Since these effects can be detected physically with sequence filters, the mathematical tool became the basis for the d...
2. ...olved. However, modern cosmology recognizes the Kelvin period in the early life of a star, during which it shines from gravitational energy (correctly calculated by Kelvin) before fusion and the main **sequence** begins. In the winter of 1860–61 Kelvin slipped on the ice while curling near his home at Netherhall and fractured his leg, causing him to miss the 1861 Manchester meeting of the British Association...
3. ...temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given "B-V" index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main **sequence** and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body "U-B" index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with...

1. ...ional life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired **sequence** of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in...
2. ...nput power. Verification of the phase sequence in a circuit is of considerable practical importance. Two sources of three-phase power must not be connected in parallel unless they have the same phase **sequence**, for example, when connecting a generator to an energized distribution network or when connecting two transformers in parallel. Otherwise, the interconnection will behave like a short circuit, and ex...
3. ...certain loads. Variable-frequency drives and digital phase converters use power electronic devices to synthesize a balanced three-phase supply from single-phase input power. Verification of the phase **sequence** in a circuit is of considerable practical importance. Two sources of three-phase power must not be connected in parallel unless they have the same phase sequence, for example, when connecting a gener...
