1. ...ons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor. For a steady **flow** of charge through a surface, the current "I" (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation: formula_5 where "Q" is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time "t". If...
2. ...urrent may be specified for a given switch design. In electronics, switches are classified according to the arrangement of their contacts. A pair of contacts is said to be ""closed"" when current can **flow** from one to the other. When the contacts are separated by an insulating air gap, they are said to be ""open"", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages. The terms ""make"" for closure...

...ice on record is thought to be the ancient Ktesibios's water clock in Alexandria, Egypt, around the third century BCE. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water **flow** from that vessel. This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols captured the city in 1258 CE. A variety of automatic devic...

...istance rises and the current decreases to a steady-state value. A switch designed for an incandescent lamp load can withstand this inrush current. "Wetting current" is the minimum current needing to **flow** through a mechanical switch while it is operated to break through any film of oxidation that may have been deposited on the switch contacts. The film of oxidation occurs often in areas with high humi...

1. ...09. Producing hard, compact, insoluble, and infusible condensation products of phenols and formaldehyde marked the beginning of the modern plastics industry. Electric current An electric current is a **flow** of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. It is defined as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface. The moving particles are...
2. ...the lattice, given by "kT", where "k" is the Boltzmann constant and "T" is the temperature, the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The Cooper pair fluid is thus a superfluid, meaning it can **flow** without energy dissipation. In the class of superconductors known as type II superconductors, including all known high-temperature superconductors, an extremely low but non-zero resistivity appears a...
3. ...nature of sources of plasma and momentum, the period of the object's spin, the nature of the axis about which the object spins, the axis of the magnetic dipole, and the magnitude and direction of the **flow** of solar wind. The planetary distance where the magnetosphere can withstand the solar wind pressure is called the Chapmanâ€“Ferraro distance. This is usefully modeled by the formula wherein formula_1 r...

A switch may be directly manipulated by a human as a control signal to a system, such as a computer keyboard button, or to control power **flow** in a circuit, such as a light switch. Automatically operated switches can be used to control the motions of machines, for example, to indicate that a garage door has reached its full open position or...
2. ...tor banks, reactors and other components (such as phase-shifters; static VAR compensators; and flexible AC transmission systems, FACTS) throughout the system help to compensate for the reactive power **flow**, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'. Current flowing through transmission lines induces a magnetic field...
3. ...ctive distance for DC transmission was . For AC it was , though US transmission lines are substantially shorter. In any AC line, conductor inductance and capacitance can be significant. Currents that **flow** solely in reaction to these properties, (which together with the resistance define the impedance) constitute reactive power flow, which transmits no power to the load. These reactive currents, howeve...
