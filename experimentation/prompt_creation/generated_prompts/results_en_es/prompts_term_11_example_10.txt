1. ...prism case, some light leaks out at the prism corners). An "acoustic waveguide" is a physical structure for guiding sound waves. Sound in an acoustic waveguide behaves like electromagnetic waves on a **transmission line**. Waves on a string, like the ones in a tin can telephone, are a simple example of an acoustic waveguide. Another example are pressure waves in the pipes of an organ. The term "acoustic waveguide" is...
2. ...Jersey, to New Bridge, New York, and Path 15 in California. Additional projects are in development or have been proposed throughout the United States, including the Lake Erie Connector, an underwater **transmission line** proposed by ITC Holdings Corp., connecting Ontario to load serving entities in the PJM Interconnection region. Australia has one unregulated or market interconnector – Basslink – between Tasmania and...

Translate these contexts into Spanish taking into account that transmission line translates as línea de transmisión in Physics > Electro-magnetism, like the following example shows:
...he analysis of lossless lines provides an accurate approximation for real transmission lines that simplifies the mathematics considered in modeling transmission lines. A lossless line is defined as a **transmission line** that has no line resistance and no dielectric loss. This would imply that the conductors act like perfect conductors and the dielectric acts like a perfect dielectric. For a lossless line, and are bo...
And as línea de transporte in Technological Sciences > Electrical technology and engineering, like the following example shows:
...pacity lines. Adding transmission lines is difficult due to cost, permit intervals, and local opposition. Reconductoring has the potential to double the amount of electricity that can travel across a **transmission line**.  A 2024 report found the United States behind countries like Belgium and the Netherlands in adoption of this technique to accommodate electrification and renewable energy. In April 2022, the Biden A...

2. ...ere along the transmission line. Their magnitudes remain constant along the length of the line and are only rotated by a phase angle. In electric power transmission, the characteristic impedance of a **transmission line** is expressed in terms of the surge impedance loading (SIL), or natural loading, being the power loading at which reactive power is neither produced nor absorbed: formula_106 in which formula_107 is t...
3. ...fficient and transmission constant. If the plural is used, it suggests that "α" and "β" are being referenced separately but collectively as in transmission parameters, propagation parameters, etc. In **transmission line** theory, "α" and "β" are counted among the "secondary coefficients", the term "secondary" being used to contrast to the "primary line coefficients". The primary coefficients are the physical propertie...

Protection of the **transmission line** from short circuits and other faults is usually so critical that common carrier telecommunications are insufficiently reliable, while in some remote areas no common carrier is available. Communicatio...

Optical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a **transmission line**, in the overhead shield wires. These cables are known as optical ground wire ("OPGW"). Sometimes a standalone cable is used, all-dielectric self-supporting ("ADSS") cable, attached to the transmissio...
