1. ...he spin with respect to the momentum of the electron defines the property of elementary particles known as helicity. The electron has no known substructure. Nevertheless, in condensed matter physics, **spin**窶田harge separation can occur in some materials. In such cases, electrons 'split' into three independent particles, the spinon, the orbiton and the holon (or chargon). The electron can always be theore...
2. ...emergency power. By using a transmission gearbox, the rotational inertia of the flywheel can be used to directly start up a diesel engine, and once running, the diesel engine can be used to directly **spin** the flywheel. Multiple flywheels can likewise be connected in parallel through mechanical countershafts, without the need for separate motors and generators for each flywheel. They are normally desig...

...es because they have no known components or substructure. The electron's mass is approximately that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (**spin**) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, . Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, per the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all elementa...

...tricity, these being natural coal, gas and nuclear forms of thermal generation. More recently solar and wind have become large scale. Natural gas is ignited to create pressurised gas which is used to **spin** turbines to generate electricity. Natural gas plants use a gas turbine where natural gas is added along with oxygen which in turn combusts and expands through the turbine to force a generator to spin...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where spin translates as spin:
1. ...etic north pole is the "south" pole (south-seeking pole) of its dipole moment and vice versa. The only known mechanisms for the creation of magnetic dipoles are by current loops or quantum-mechanical **spin** since the existence of magnetic monopoles has never been experimentally demonstrated. A "physical dipole" consists of two equal and opposite point charges: in the literal sense, two poles. Its field...

The Curie temperature itself is a critical point, where the magnetic susceptibility is theoretically infinite and, although there is no net magnetization, domain-like **spin** correlations fluctuate at all length scales. The study of ferromagnetic phase transitions, especially via the simplified Ising spin model, had an important impact on the development of statistical ph...

1. ...drives and failure of electronic components on flash storage. Impending failure on hard disk drives is estimable using S.M.A.R.T. diagnostic data that includes the hours of operation and the count of **spin**-ups, though its reliability is disputed. Flash storage may experience downspiking transfer rates as a result of accumulating errors, which the flash memory controller attempts to correct. The health...

Manufacturers have devised several ways to control the motion of the agitator during the wash and rinse separately from the high-speed rotation of the drum required for the **spin** cycle. While a top-loading washing machine could use a universal motor or DC brushless motor, it is conventional for top-loading washing machines to use more expensive, heavy, and potentially more el...
