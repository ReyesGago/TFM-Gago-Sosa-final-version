1. ...es because they have no known components or substructure. The electron's mass is approximately that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (**spin**) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, . Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, per the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all elementa...
2. ...tricity, these being natural coal, gas and nuclear forms of thermal generation. More recently solar and wind have become large scale. Natural gas is ignited to create pressurised gas which is used to **spin** turbines to generate electricity. Natural gas plants use a gas turbine where natural gas is added along with oxygen which in turn combusts and expands through the turbine to force a generator to spin...

Translate these contexts into Spanish taking into account that spin translates as spin in Physics > Electro-magnetism, like the following example shows:
...eaking the picture is the following: An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite **spin**, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very stro...

...ecause it is "near to online". The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is: For example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that **spin** down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks (MAID), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in tape libraries, are nearline...

1. ...it, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment. This is analogous to the rotation of the Earth on its axis as it orbits the Sun. The intrinsic angular momentum became known as **spin**, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting. In his 1924 dissertation "" (R...
2. ...nce to be determined. In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, **spin** and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle prop...
3. ...omentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their **spin** quantum number. Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer i...

1. ...entary demonstration of jet power dates back to the aeolipile, a device described by Hero of Alexandria in 1st-century Egypt. This device directed steam power through two nozzles to cause a sphere to **spin** rapidly on its axis. It was seen as a curiosity. Meanwhile, practical applications of the turbine can be seen in the water wheel and the windmill.  Historians have further traced the theoretical orig...

The machine would fill with only a small amount of water and the two wash plates would **spin**, tumbling the load within it, mimicking the action of a front-loading washer in a vertical-axis design. In 2006, Sanyo introduced the "world-first" (as of February 2, 2006, with regards to home use d...
3. ...athhouses throughout the nineteenth century. Washer design improved during the 1930s. The mechanism was now enclosed within a cabinet, and more attention was paid to electrical and mechanical safety. **Spin** dryers were introduced to replace the dangerous power mangle/wringers of the day. By 1940, 60% of the 25,000,000 wired homes in the United States had an electric washing machine. Many of these machin...
