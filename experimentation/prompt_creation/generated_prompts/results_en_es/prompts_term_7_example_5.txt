Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which ionizes more gas molecules (where the degree of ionization is determined by temperature), and as per this **sequence**: solid-liquid-gas-plasma; the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium; the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the atoms, molecules, ion...
2. ...e, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate. Progressive scanning, the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in **sequence**, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning, in effect, doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1...

However, modern cosmology recognizes the Kelvin period in the early life of a star, during which it shines from gravitational energy (correctly calculated by Kelvin) before fusion and the main **sequence** begins. In the winter of 1860–61 Kelvin slipped on the ice while curling near his home at Netherhall and fractured his leg, causing him to miss the 1861 Manchester meeting of the British Association...

Two sources of three-phase power must not be connected in parallel unless they have the same phase **sequence**, for example, when connecting a generator to an energized distribution network or when connecting two transformers in parallel. Otherwise, the interconnection will behave like a short circuit, and ex...

1. ...temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given "B-V" index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main **sequence** and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body "U-B" index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with...
2. ...n be substituted for for all photon momentum terms which arise in course of the derivation below. The derivation which appears in Compton's paper is more terse, but follows the same logic in the same **sequence** as the following derivation. The conservation of energy formula_18 merely equates the sum of energies before and after scattering. Compton postulated that photons carry momentum; thus from the conser...
3. ...tector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded. A spectrograph is sometimes called polychromator, as an analogy to monochromator. The star spectral classification and discovery of the main **sequence**, Hubble's law and the Hubble sequence were all made with spectrographs that used photographic paper. James Webb Space Telescope contains both a near-infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec) and a mid-infrared...

Verification of the phase **sequence** in a circuit is of considerable practical importance. Two sources of three-phase power must not be connected in parallel unless they have the same phase sequence, for example, when connecting a gener...

Though W-CDMA does use a direct-**sequence** CDMA transmission technique like CDMA2000, W-CDMA is not simply a wideband version of CDMA2000 and differs in many aspects from CDMA2000. From an engineering point of view, W-CDMA provides a differen...

Presently, there are three distinct categories of logic analyzers available on the market: A logic analyzer can be triggered on a complicated **sequence** of digital events, then capture a large amount of digital data from the system under test (SUT). When logic analyzers first came into use, it was common to attach several hundred "clips" to a digital...
