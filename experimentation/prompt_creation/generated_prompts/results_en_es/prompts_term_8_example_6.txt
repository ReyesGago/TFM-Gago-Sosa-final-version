2. ...work for the design team. Most chips will go through a series of iterations, called "spins", in which errors are detected and fixed after testing the first article. Many different factors can cause a **spin**, including: The roots of the term can be traced back to the time when paper tape and later magnetic tape reels were loaded with the final electronic files used to create the photomask at the factory....

...it, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment. This is analogous to the rotation of the Earth on its axis as it orbits the Sun. The intrinsic angular momentum became known as **spin**, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting.

...entary demonstration of jet power dates back to the aeolipile, a device described by Hero of Alexandria in 1st-century Egypt. This device directed steam power through two nozzles to cause a sphere to **spin** rapidly on its axis. It was seen as a curiosity. Meanwhile, practical applications of the turbine can be seen in the water wheel and the windmill.  Historians have further traced the theoretical orig...

1. ...nce to be determined. In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, **spin** and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle prop...
2. ...etic north pole is the "south" pole (south-seeking pole) of its dipole moment and vice versa. The only known mechanisms for the creation of magnetic dipoles are by current loops or quantum-mechanical **spin** since the existence of magnetic monopoles has never been experimentally demonstrated. A "physical dipole" consists of two equal and opposite point charges: in the literal sense, two poles. Its field...
