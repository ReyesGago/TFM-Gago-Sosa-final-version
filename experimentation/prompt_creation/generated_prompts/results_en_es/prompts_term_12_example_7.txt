1. ...up velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling instantaneously or backwards in time. None of these options allow information to be transmitted faster than "c". It is impossible to **transmit** information with a light pulse any faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the front velocity). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always equal to "c".  It is p...
2. ...ula_22 should be replaced with formula_23 (the line length) in all parameters of the transmission matrix. This model applies the Telegrapher's equations. High-voltage direct current (HVDC) is used to **transmit** large amounts of power over long distances or for interconnections between asynchronous grids. When electrical energy is transmitted over very long distances, the power lost in AC transmission become...

...ile this was the birth, there have been a large number of further developments since then. There are many types and techniques of electron diffraction. The most common approach is where the electrons **transmit** through a thin sample, from 1 nm to 100 nm (10 to 1000 atoms thick), where the results depending upon how the atoms are arranged in the material, for instance a single crystal, many crystals or diffe...

The development of digital data communications methods made it possible to digitize voice and **transmit** it as real-time data across computer networks and the Internet, giving rise to the field of Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, also known as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). VoIP has proven to be...

1.  ...xclusion of others. The most extreme example of digital spread-spectrum signalling to date is ultra-wideband (UWB), which proposes the use of large sections of the radio spectrum at low amplitudes to **transmit** high-bandwidth digital data. UWB, if used exclusively, would enable very efficient use of the spectrum, but users of non-UWB technology are not yet prepared to share the spectrum with the new system...

3. ...transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to **transmit** large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications. At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no...

1. ...a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity. In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to **transmit** power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were...

3. ...band attenuation. On shared-antenna sites, the bandpass duplexer variety is greatly preferred because this virtually eliminates interference between transmitters and receivers by removing out-of-band **transmit** emissions and considerably improving the selectivity of receivers. Most professionally engineered sites ban the use of notch duplexers and insist on bandpass duplexers for this reason. "Note 1:" A du...
