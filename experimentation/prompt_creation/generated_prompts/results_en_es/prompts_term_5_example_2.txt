1. ...source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves, but modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source there is an **isolator** which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency. The microwave power from the source is then passed through a directional co...
2. ...is briefly in contact with both wires). In normal service, the two sections are electrically connected; depending on the system this might be an isolator, fixed contact or a Booster Transformer. The **isolator** allows the current to the section to be interrupted for maintenance. On overhead wires designed for trolley poles, this is done by having a neutral section between the wires, requiring an insulator....

More tails proceed from the meter into a consumer unit (or fusebox in older installations), possibly via an **isolator**. Some installations may have multiple consumer units (or an old fusebox along with one or more consumer units), in which case the meter tails may first go into a junction box from which they split ou...

1. ...l charge is the electric current integrated over time : Here is the "total" electrolysis time. Lightning arrester A lightning arrester (alternative spelling lightning arrestor) (also called lightning **isolator**) is a device, essentially an air gap between an electric wire and ground, used on electric power transmission and telecommunication systems to protect the insulation and conductors of the system from...

3. ...ion. Atomic vapours, however, can have Verdet constants which are orders of magnitude larger than TGG, but only over a very narrow wavelength range. Alkali vapours can therefore be used as an optical **isolator** or as an extremely sensitive magnetometer. The Faraday effect is chromatic (i.e. it depends on wavelength), and therefore the Verdet constant is quite a strong function of wavelength. At 632.8Â nm, th...

1. ...an installation will also normally provide a main switch (known as an "incomer") which switches the phase and neutral lines for the whole supply. (n.b., an incomer may be referred to, or sold as, an "**isolator**", but this is problematic, as it will not necessarily be used as an isolator in the strict sense.) For each phase, power is fed along a busbar. In split-phase panels, separate busbars are fed directl...
