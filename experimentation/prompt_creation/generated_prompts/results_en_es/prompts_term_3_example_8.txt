About 20–30% of the discharge current is an electron current, which does not produce thrust, thus limiting the energetic **efficiency** of the thruster; the other 70–80% of the current is in the ions. Because the majority of electrons are trapped in the Hall current, they have a long residence time inside the thruster and are able to...

High-voltage power transmission allows for lesser resistive losses over long distances. This **efficiency** delivers a larger proportion of the generated power to the loads. In a simplified model, the grid delivers electricity from an ideal voltage source with voltage formula_3, delivering a power formula_...

...s resistance dissipates some of the reactive energy. The quality factor (or "Q") of an inductor is the ratio of its inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and is a measure of its **efficiency**. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal inductor. High Q inductors are used with capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and rec...

A standard definition is used to assess how different things change engine **efficiency** and also to allow comparisons to be made between different engines. This definition is called specific fuel consumption, or how much fuel is needed to produce one unit of thrust. For example, it will...

The mass use efficiency of the thruster is thus around 90%, while the discharge current **efficiency** is around 70%, for a combined thruster efficiency of around 63% (= 90% × 70%). Modern Hall thrusters have achieved efficiencies as high as 75% through advanced designs. Compared to chemical rockets,...
