1. ...lamette Falls to the city of Portland down river. The first three-phase alternating current using high voltage took place in 1891 during the international electricity exhibition in Frankfurt. A 15 kV **transmission line**, approximately 175 km long, connected Lauffen on the Neckar and Frankfurt. Transmission voltages increased throughout the 20th century. By 1914, fifty-five transmission systems operating at more than...
2. ...onnection would: (and possibly in other cooperating cities along the transmission route). Such a system could be less prone to failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down. One example of a long DC **transmission line** is the Pacific DC Intertie located in the Western United States. The amount of power that can be sent over a transmission line varies with the length of the line. The heating of short line conductors...

...prism case, some light leaks out at the prism corners). An "acoustic waveguide" is a physical structure for guiding sound waves. Sound in an acoustic waveguide behaves like electromagnetic waves on a **transmission line**. Waves on a string, like the ones in a tin can telephone, are a simple example of an acoustic waveguide. Another example are pressure waves in the pipes of an organ. The term "acoustic waveguide" is...

Additional projects are in development or have been proposed throughout the United States, including the Lake Erie Connector, an underwater **transmission line** proposed by ITC Holdings Corp., connecting Ontario to load serving entities in the PJM Interconnection region. Australia has one unregulated or market interconnector – Basslink – between Tasmania and...

Examples in Physics > Electro-magnetism, where transmission line translates as línea de transmisión:
1. ...amplifier's output capacitively couples to its input it may become an electronic oscillator. Characteristic impedance The characteristic impedance or surge impedance (usually written Z) of a uniform **transmission line** is the ratio of the amplitudes of voltage and current of a wave travelling in one direction along the line in the absence of reflections in the other direction. Equivalently, it can be defined as the...
2. ...al justification for Heaviside's operator method using contour integration. Heaviside was familiar with the Laplace transform method but considered his own method more direct. Heaviside developed the **transmission line** theory (also known as the "telegrapher's equations"), which had the effect of increasing the transmission rate over transatlantic cables by a factor of ten. It originally took ten minutes to transmit...
3. ...ere along the transmission line. Their magnitudes remain constant along the length of the line and are only rotated by a phase angle. In electric power transmission, the characteristic impedance of a **transmission line** is expressed in terms of the surge impedance loading (SIL), or natural loading, being the power loading at which reactive power is neither produced nor absorbed: formula_106 in which formula_107 is t...

1. ...failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down. One example of a long DC transmission line is the Pacific DC Intertie located in the Western United States. The amount of power that can be sent over a **transmission line** varies with the length of the line. The heating of short line conductors due to line losses sets a thermal limit. If too much current is drawn, conductors may sag too close to the ground, or conducto...
2. ...hronous grids. When electrical energy is transmitted over very long distances, the power lost in AC transmission becomes appreciable and it is less expensive to use direct current instead. For a long **transmission line**, these lower losses (and reduced construction cost of a DC line) can offset the cost of the required converter stations at each end. HVDC is used for long submarine cables where AC cannot be used bec...
3. ...ays at each end of the line must communicate to monitor the flow of power so that faulted conductors or equipment can be quickly de-energized and the balance of the system restored. Protection of the **transmission line** from short circuits and other faults is usually so critical that common carrier telecommunications are insufficiently reliable, while in some remote areas no common carrier is available. Communicatio...
