Translate these contexts into Spanish:
1. ...running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high **efficiency**. Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnectio...
2. ...et engine at rest, as on a test stand, sucks in fuel and generates thrust. How well it does this is judged by how much fuel it uses and what force is required to restrain it. This is a measure of its **efficiency**. If something deteriorates inside the engine (known as performance deterioration) it will be less efficient and this will show when the fuel produces less thrust. If a change is made to an internal p...

Translate these contexts into Spanish taking into account that efficiency translates as eficiencia in Physics > Electro-magnetism, like the following example shows:
...energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip **efficiency** is greater than 95%. Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the high cost of superconducting wire, SMES is currently used for short duration energy storage. Therefore, SMES is most commo...
And as rendimiento in Technological Sciences > Electrical technology and engineering, like the following example shows:
...d energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers with a low power factor. Power-factor correction increases the power factor of a load, improving **efficiency** for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with a low power factor (such as induction motors) can be corrected with a passive network of capacitors or inductors. Non-linear loa...

2. ...single-photon detectors offer high speed, low noise single-photon detection and have been employed widely in advanced photon-counting applications. Other early markets are arising where the relative **efficiency**, size and weight advantages of devices based on high-temperature superconductivity outweigh the additional costs involved. For example, in wind turbines the lower weight and volume of superconducting...
3. ...effect by Augustin-Jean Fresnel, in 1823, added to the evidence in favor of the wave theory of light. The phase shifts are used by Fresnel's invention, the Fresnel rhomb, to modify polarization. The **efficiency** of the total internal reflection is exploited by optical fibers (used in telecommunications cables and in image-forming fiberscopes), and by reflective prisms, such as image-erecting Porro/roof prism...

This understanding comes under the engineering discipline Jet engine performance. How **efficiency** is affected by forward speed and by supplying energy to aircraft systems is mentioned later. The efficiency of the engine is controlled primarily by the operating conditions inside the engine which a...

A three-phase induction motor has a simple design, inherently high starting torque and high **efficiency**. Such motors are applied in industry for many applications. A three-phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor of the same voltage class and rating, and single-phase AC mot...
