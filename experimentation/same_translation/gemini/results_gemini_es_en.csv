While ""couple"" works in both contexts, using ""combine"" in the first example clarifies the meaning.  ""Coupling"" implies a more intricate interaction than simply adding the values together, which might be misleading for someone unfamiliar with the physics concept.  ""Combine"" in this context more directly translates the act of adding the angular momenta.  ""Couple"" is still appropriate in the second example, as it suggests a close relationship between the cores.

The second new example seems to be discussing a control system, likely related to automation or robotics.

Explanation of choices:

* **""vuelta"" in example 1:** In the context of a resonant cavity or resonator, ""viaje de ida y vuelta"" clearly refers to the wave's complete cycle, going from one end of the resonator to the other and back.  ""Round trip"" is the standard term for this in physics and optics.

* **""vuelta"" in example 2:** While related to cyclical energy transfer, the phrase ""de ida y vuelta"" here refers to the oscillating nature of energy flow rather than a physical path.  ""Back and forth"" captures this meaning.  The second instance of ""vuelta"" within ""en el viaje"" is more idiomatically translated as ""way"" or ""journey"" in this context.  The focus is on the loss occurring *during* the transfer, rather than the cyclical nature itself.
