# TFM- Specialized Terminology and Polysemic Variation

This repository accompanies the Master's Thesis (TFM) titled  
_**Specialized Terminology and Polysemic Variation: Guiding Large Language Models in the Translation of Domain-Specific Polysemous Terms**_ of the Master in Language Analysis and Processing of Basque Country University (UPV/EHU).
The main objective of the project is to **evaluate the term-level translation performance of language models when dealing with terminological polysemy** in specialised texts, using contextualised terminological resources and prompting techniques.

The repository is organised into **three functional blocks**:

---

## 1. `term_obtention` – Detection of polysemous terms

This block focuses on the **automatic identification of polysemous terms** shared across multiple specialised domains in three languages: Spanish, Basque, and English.

- Three filtering processes are applied to select the **10 domain pairs** that share the highest number of polysemous terms and their corresponding term mappings.
- The results are presented in **CSV files** organised in folders. The following table shows an example of the structure, selecting only one term from each domain:

| Language pair | Source term    | Target term     | Domain                                                            |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BA-EN         | osagai         | ingredient      | Medical Sciences > Pharmaceutical Technology                      |
|               |                | component       | Technological Sciences > Environmental Technology and Engineering |
| BA-ES         | urradura       | rozadura        | Medical Sciences > Pharmaceutical Technology                      |

| EN-BA         | destruction    | hondamen        | Medical Sciences > Pharmaceutical Technology                      |

## 2. `context_obtention` – Context extraction and resource construction

In this phase, **real usage contexts** of the polysemous terms are extracted from **Wikipedia** and the terminological corpus **Garaterm**.

- The work focuses on one of the selected domain pairs.
- The file `terms_and_contexts_final_selection_all_languages.xlsx` is constructed, containing the contextualised terminological resource used for experimentation.
- This block includes:
  - **Up to 10 usage examples per term** and per domain of the selected pair.
  - **Thematic datasets** extracted from Wikipedia for each specialised domain.
  - **Labels and filters applied** to obtain the corpus.

## 3. `experimentation` – Language model testing and evaluation

This block covers the **experimentation with large language models (LLMs)** using different prompting strategies:

- Variants include: `0-shot`, `0-shot-plus`, `1-shot`, and `few-shot`.
- Scripts are provided to automate prompt creation based on the resource.
- Responses generated by several **models** are included:
  - **GPT** (OpenAI)
  - **Gemini** (Google)
  - **LLaMA** (Meta)
  - **Latxa** (UPV/EHU)
- The evaluation notebook `notebook_analysis` is included in the following path: experimentation/same_translation/results_analysis

It contains:
- The evaluation system by term and context.
- Graphs with comparative results between models and prompting strategies.

## Additional Information

- The **API keys** required to run the models have been **removed for privacy reasons**. To replicate the experiments, you must enter your own keys.
